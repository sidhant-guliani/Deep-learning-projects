## Deep learning projects
The projects includes the online available (mainly kaggle/keras) datasets. Following is the information about the jupyter notebooks.

### 1_classifying_movie_reviews.ipynb
I this section we are using IMDb dataset, the IMDB sentiment classification dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB users that are labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0).

Summary: To prevent overfititng in neural networks following are the standard techniques:
Number | Technique
------------ | -------------
1 | Getting more training data.
2 | Reducing the capacity of the network.
3 | Adding weight regularization.
4 | Adding dropout.

Open database (classifying white/red wine based on chemical properties)
---> steps: Data manipulation + data modeling


Processing data:  Split up your data in train and test sets and standardize the data,

Build multi-layer perceptrons for classification tasks,

Compile and fit the data to the models,

Use the model to predict target values, and

Validate the model.

Bonus: Build a model for regression tasks, and fine-tune the model that we built.

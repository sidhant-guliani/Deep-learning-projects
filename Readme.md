Keras tutorial


----> Open database (classifying white/red wine based on chemical properties)


---> steps: Data manipulation + data modeling


Processing data:  Split up your data in train and test sets and standardize the data,

Build multi-layer perceptrons for classification tasks,

Compile and fit the data to the models,

Use the model to predict target values, and

Validate the model.

Bonus: Build a model for regression tasks, and fine-tune the model that we built.

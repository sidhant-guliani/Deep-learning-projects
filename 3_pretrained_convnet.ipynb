    "# Using a pretrained network\n",
    "\n",
    "A pretrained network is simply a saved network previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large scale image classification task. If this original dataset si large enough and general enough, then the spatial feature hierarchy learned by the pre trained network can effectively act as generic model for our visual world. Hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, one might train a network on ImageNet (where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects) and then re-purpose this trained network for something as remote as identifying furniture items in images. Such portability of learned features across different problems is a key advantage of deep learning compared to many older shallow learning approaches, and it makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to leverage a pre-trained network: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    feature extraction \n",
    "    fine-tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps three of the more popular models are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    VGG (e.g. VGG16 or VGG19).\n",
    "    GoogLeNet (e.g. InceptionV3).\n",
    "    Residual Network (e.g. ResNet50).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are both widely used for transfer learning both because of their performance, but also because they were examples that introduced specific architectural innovations, namely consistent and repeating structures (VGG), inception modules (GoogLeNet), and residual modules (ResNet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this in practice by using the convolutional base of the VGG16 network, trained on ImageNet, to extract interesting features from our cat and dog images, and then training a cat vs. dog classifier on top of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with feature extraction."
